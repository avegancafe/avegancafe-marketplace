# avegancafe

Kyle's personal Claude Code plugin — a home for one-off skills that don't
warrant a plugin of their own.

## Install

```bash
/plugin install avegancafe --marketplace avegancafe/avegancafe-marketplace
```

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `work-notes-vault` | Kyle's private Obsidian work vault, [`avegancafe/notes--work`](https://github.com/avegancafe/notes--work) (expected at `~/workspace/notes--work/`): locating/refreshing it, its layout, and its weekly-synced **Granola meeting archive** (`granola/notes/`, `.md` + raw `.json`) — schema, `rg`/`jq` mining recipes, freshness limits, and what not to touch. Lets Claude "mine my Granola meetings for X" from any working directory; the vault's own `.claude/CLAUDE.md` stays the authority on its conventions. No meeting content lives here — only the archive's structure. |
